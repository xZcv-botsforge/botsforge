### **Bot Management**
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy bots directly to scalable cloud infrastructure.
- **GitHub Integration**: Sync bot projects with GitHub repositories for version control and collaboration.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Build bots for Telegram, Discord, and more (extensible to other platforms).

### **Collaboration & Scaling**
- **Team Collaboration**: Work together on bot projects with shared access and permissions.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Bots automatically scale based on demand (future goal).
